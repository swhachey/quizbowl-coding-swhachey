# quizbowl-coding-swhachey

This is a Quiz Bowl game to test your knowledge on coding within a given time span.

I created this file using html, css, and javscript. It gets almost all the way through. The refrsh button is broken. There is commented out code in the js file that were ideas i was working on to complete the bonus portions. If I were to be able to have this for an extra day and after learning some jQuery techiniques in class today, I would've been able to do a better and thorough job on this assignment. I'll probably refactor the code at some point in the future.
